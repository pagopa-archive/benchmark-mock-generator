# Benchmark Mock Generator

## Goal

Benchmark a bunch of tool that given an `OpenAPI` produces a mock. Evaluate the following requirements:

1. Let you override specific endpoints
2. Let you keep some state between successive API calls
3. Validate requests payload
4. Let you write some assertion
5. Can record network calls
6. Can reply the recorded calls
